    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  Artificial Intelligence, Computer science, and linguistics are concerned with creating computational models that process and understand natural language. These include: making the computer understand the semantic grouping of words (e.g. cat and dog are semantically more similar than cat and spoon), text to speech, language translation and many more.\n",
    "* **Sentiment Analysis/ Opinion mining:** It is a natural language processing technique that determines whether textual data is negative, neutral or positive. Businesses use it to detect social data sentiment, gauge brand reputation and products by customer feedback, and understand customer needs.\n",

    "Text classification categorizes documents or pieces of text by examining the word usage in a text using classifiers to decide what class label to assign to those texts. For instance, a binary classifier decides between two labels, such as cat or dog, positive or negative; this way, the text can either be one label or another, but not both, whereas a multi-label classifier can assign one or more labels to a piece of text. The classification works by learning from labelled feature sets or training data to classify an unlabeled feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some standard techniques for Sentiment Analysis like `Bag of words(BOW)`, `Tokenization`, `Lemmatization`, `Stemming`, `Stopwords` for data preprocessing would not be relevant for this specific problem. Although they are compelling from a good feature engineering point of view, when we implemented it in the early stages of this project, we had to eliminate substantial parts of the data that compound emojis and make feelings sense. We aborted the mission for an alternative way, following our central idea, which is to classify input texts in POSITIVE or NEGATIVE mixing with emojis at the exact string. We decided to use tf-idf.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** is a fundamental technique for analyzing words in documents and retrieving relevant documents from a corpus (collection).  It can query a corpus by calculating normalized scores that express the relative importance of terms in the documents. Mathematically, TF-IDF expresses the term frequency and the inverse document frequency, `tf_idf = tf*idf`, where the term represents the importance of a term in a specific document. It represents the importance of a term relative to the entire collection by multiplying these terms together to produce a score that accounts for both factors, and it has been a crucial part of every major search engine until now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning with natural language is one of the major hurdles – its algorithms usually deal with numbers, and natural language is, essentially, text. So `we need to transform texts into numbers`, otherwise known as `text vectorization`. It is a fundamental step in machine learning for analyzing data, and different vectorization algorithms will drastically affect results, so we need to choose one between `Tfidftransformer` and `Tfidfvectorizer` that will deliver the results we expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `Tfidftransformer` we will systematically compute word counts using `CountVectorizer` and then compute the `Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)` values and then compute the Tf-idf scores.\n",
    "With `Tfidfvectorizer`, on the contrary, we will do all three steps at once. It computes the word counts, IDF values, and Tf-idf scores, all using the same dataset under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use what?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We may be wondering why we should use more steps than necessary if we can get everything done in two steps. There are cases where we want to use Tfidftransformer over Tfidfvectorizer, which is sometimes not that obvious (Kavita Ganesan, Ph.D\n",
    ",n.d.). Here is a general guideline:\n",
    "- If we need the term frequency (term count) vectors for different tasks, use `Tfidftransformer`.\n",
    "- If we need to compute tf-idf scores on documents within our “training” dataset, use `Tfidfvectorizer`\n",
    "- If we need to compute tf-idf scores on documents outside our “training” dataset, use either one; **both will work**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After carefully analyzing both option, we decided the `Tfidfvectorizer` will be the best option to transform words into numbers in a way that machine learning algorithms can understand, the `TF-IDF` score can be fed to algorithms such as `Naive Bayes` and `Support Vector Machines`, significantly improving the results of more basic methods like word counts.\n",

    "**Transformers** are for pre-processing before modelling. The Imputer class (like SimpleImputer for filling in missing values) and FeatureSelection classes in sklearn are examples of some transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Models** are used to make predictions like the Linear Regression model, Decision Tree model, Random Forest model. We will usually pre-process our data (with transformers) before putting it in a model.\n",
    "Now the usage of methods fit(), transform(), fit_transform() and predict() depend on the type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Transformers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `fit()` - It is used for calculating the initial filling of parameters on the training data (like mean of the column values) and saves them as an internal objects state\n",
    "2. `transform()` - Use the above-calculated values and return modified training data\n",
    "3. `fit_transform()` - It joins above two steps. Internally, it just calls first fit() and then transform() on the same data. (StackExchange, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `fit()` - It calculates the parameters/weights on training data (e.g. parameters returned by coef() in case of Linear Regression) and saves them as an internal objects state.\n",
    "2. `predict()` - Use the above-calculated weights on test data to make the predictions\n",
    "3. `transform()` - Cannot be used\n",
    "4. `fit_transform()` - Cannot be used \n",

    "After we split the data, we have to choose which algorithm to use; we tried `Linear Support Vector`, `Logistic Regression`, `Random Forest`, but they all got not more than 80% accuracy, `Naive Bayes` was our choice, and it is perfect to use in a large dataset like ours. Also, it is known to outperform even these highly sophisticated classification methods, we reached `85% accuracy`, and we could keep emojis and special characters. Although this classification algorithm has three types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Gaussian:` Used in classification problems, and it assumes that features follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "- `Multinomial:` Used for discrete counts, which is perfect for our text classification problem because it counts how frequent a  word appears in the document over a number X of trials.\n",
    "- `Bernoulli:` The binomial model is helpful if our feature vectors are binary (i.e. zeros and ones). One application would be text classification with the 'bag of words' model using the 1s and 0s for \"words occurring in the document\" and \"words not occurring in the document\" but, we are not using a bag of words.\n"
